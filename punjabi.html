    <h1>Punjabi Study</h1>

    <p>Here are some guided self-study materials intended to help with Punjabi study. Currently we do not have any material to study the writing system, but I will share some links to videos from instructors who I believe teach it much better than I can. For now, lessons will include Gurmukhi, romanization, and English translations of all sentences.</p>

    <p>For this material, we are jumping right into sentences we can use in real conversations. You can learn greetings, introductions, etc. on your own time. We're not going to have lengthy explanations of anything yet. We're going to be memorizing simple sentences and slowly making them more complicated over time. Don't worry about understanding 100% of each sentence or being able to make out 100% of the words you hear for now. Continually introducing new material before you reach 100% is the Flülli way.</p>
