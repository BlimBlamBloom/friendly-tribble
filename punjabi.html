    <h1>Punjabi</h1>

    <p>Here are some guided self-study materials intended to help with Punjabi study. I will share some links to videos to learn Gurmukhi rather than creating any content for that here. Lessons will include Gurmukhi, romanization, and English translations of all sentences.</p>

    <p>We are jumping right into sentences we can use in real conversations. We're not going to have lengthy explanations for now. We're going to be memorizing simple sentences and their translations. Then we will slowly making them more complicated over time. </p>
    
    <p>Don't worry about understanding 100% of each sentence for now. It's okay and actually encouraged to constantly have a certain level of confusion at all times. Continually introducing new material before you reach 100% is the Flülli way.</p>
