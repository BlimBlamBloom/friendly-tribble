    <!-- Story Title -->
    <h1>Jay’s Han River Commute</h1>

    <!-- Story Content -->
    <p>My name is Jay, and I live in Mapo. Every morning, I cycle to work. I start my journey early, around 5AM, so I can enjoy watching the sunrise as I ride. This morning, the weather was perfect—about 18 degrees and not a cloud in sight! Yesterday it rained all day, so the air smelled fresh and clean. And there was no fine dust—a perfect day for cycling. I stopped several times to take pictures along the way.</p>
    <p>I passed by a small stream in Banpo, and the water was so clear. It's Spring now, so I could see a whole family of ducks. I tried to video-call my wife to show her how cute the ducklings were, but she was still sleeping. She got annoyed and hung up. Oops. I’ll show her the video when I get home.</p>
    <p>After about an hour, I arrived at the office near Yangjae station. There were no spots left to park my bike near Exit 1, so I had to park a bit farther away and jog to avoid being late. Good thing I left early. Now, it's time to start working before my boss notices I'm slacking off. I can't wait to see the sunset on my ride home. Maybe the ducklings will still be there, and maybe my wife will forget about me waking her up at 5:30 in the morning... But probably not. She usually remembers those kinds of things. We'll see.</p>
