    <h1>The Capybara: South America's Gentle Giant Rodent</h1>

    <p>Have you ever heard of an animal called the capybara? It's a very special creature that lives in South America. Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world. They look a bit like giant guinea pigs!</p>

    <p>Capybaras live near water in many parts of South America. You can find them in countries like Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. They love to swim and can stay underwater for up to five minutes. Their webbed feet help them swim very well.</p>

    <p>These animals are quite big. An adult capybara can weigh up to 65 kilograms. That's about the same as a big dog! They have reddish-brown fur and small ears. Their eyes and nose are high on their head, which helps them see and breathe while swimming.</p>

    <p>Capybaras are very friendly animals. They live in groups called herds. A herd can have up to 100 capybaras! They like to spend time together, often touching and grooming each other. This helps them stay close as a group.</p>

    <p>These gentle giants eat mostly grass. They can eat up to 3.5 kilograms of grass every day! Sometimes they also eat water plants and fruits. Like other rodents, their teeth never stop growing. Eating tough grass helps keep their teeth short.</p>

    <p>Many other animals like to be around capybaras. Birds often sit on their backs to eat small insects. Sometimes you can even see small monkeys or baby caimans riding on a capybara's back!</p>

    <p>In some parts of South America, people think capybaras are very special. In Venezuela, it's a tradition to eat capybara meat during Easter. But in many places, people just like to watch these calm, friendly animals in nature.</p>

    <p>Visitors to South America often hope to see capybaras. Whether they're swimming in a river or relaxing in the sun, these giant rodents are always a fun and interesting sight!</p>
