    <!-- Story Title -->
    <h1>An International Journey to School: Point Roberts</h1>

    <p>Point Roberts is a small town in the United States, but it’s a little different from most American towns. This town is separated from the rest of the country by Canada! To go to school, students in Point Roberts have to take a special trip every day.</p>

    <p>Each morning, students leave their homes in Point Roberts and head toward the Canadian border. They cross into Canada and travel through the city of Tsawwassen. Then they head south again and cross back into the United States to get to Blaine, Washington. This means they have to go through two border checkpoints every day, both on the way to school and on the way home. The whole journey takes about an hour each way!</p>

    <p>The reason for this unique situation dates back to the Treaty of 1846 between the United States and the United Kingdom. The border between the U.S. and Canada was drawn along the 49th parallel, but this line cut through the small peninsula where Point Roberts is located. As a result, the town became part of the United States, even though it is surrounded by Canadian land and water on three sides.</p>

    <p>For students in Point Roberts, this is a normal routine. Many of them are used to it, and the long commute has become just another part of their daily life. It may be a long trip, but on the bright side, students get to travel internationally every day.</p>

    <p>In addition to its unique location, Point Roberts is known for its quiet, small-town charm. The town is popular with Canadians who visit to enjoy the local beaches and parks, especially during the summer. Popular sightseeing spots include Monument Park, the Enchanted Forest Trail, and Lighthouse Marine Park. Point Roberts has just over a thousand residents, making it a close-knit community with a peaceful atmosphere.</p>
