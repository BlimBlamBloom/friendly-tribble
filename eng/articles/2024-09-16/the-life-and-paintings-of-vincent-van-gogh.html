    <!-- Story Title -->
    <h1>The Life and Paintings of Vincent van Gogh</h1>

    <p>Vincent van Gogh, a Dutch post-impressionist painter, is one of the most famous and influential figures in Western art history. Born in 1853 in the Netherlands, van Gogh's journey as an artist was both brilliant and troubled. His unique style and vibrant use of colour have captivated art lovers for generations.</p>

    <p>Van Gogh didn't start painting until his late twenties. Before that, he worked as an art dealer and a missionary. When he finally turned to art, he taught himself to draw and paint. His early works were dark and earthy, often depicting the hard lives of peasants and workers.</p>

    <p>In 1886, van Gogh moved to Paris, where he discovered the works of the Impressionists. This experience transformed his painting style. He began to use brighter colours and developed his characteristic bold brushstrokes. During this time, he painted many self-portraits, which helped him practise his techniques.</p>

    <p>Van Gogh then moved to the south of France, hoping to establish an artists' community. It was here, in Arles, that he created some of his most famous works, including "Sunflowers" and "The Yellow House". He was incredibly productive during this period, sometimes completing a painting a day.</p>

    <p>However, van Gogh struggled with mental health issues throughout his life. In a famous incident, he cut off part of his own ear during a mental breakdown. He spent time in a psychiatric hospital, where he continued to paint, creating works like "The Starry Night".</p>

    <p>Tragically, van Gogh's life was cut short. He died in 1890 at the age of 37, likely from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. During his lifetime, he sold only one painting. Today, however, his works are among the most expensive ever sold, and he is celebrated as a misunderstood genius who changed the course of modern art.</p>

    <p>Van Gogh's legacy lives on through his artwork, which continues to inspire and move people around the world. His bold colours, expressive brushstrokes, and emotional honesty speak to viewers more than a century after his death, cementing his place as one of the greatest artists in history.</p>
