    <!-- Story Title -->
    <h1>The Great Wall of China: A Marvel of Ancient Engineering</h1>

    <p>The Great Wall of China is one of the most impressive structures in the world. Built over many centuries, it stretches across the northern part of China for thousands of kilometres. The wall was originally constructed to protect Chinese states and empires from nomadic invasions, but today it stands as a symbol of Chinese civilisation and a popular tourist attraction.</p>

    <p>Construction of the Great Wall began more than 2,000 years ago during the Warring States period (475-221 BCE). However, the most famous parts of the wall were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE). The wall was made from various materials, including stone, brick, rammed earth, and even sticky rice!</p>

    <p>Despite its name, the Great Wall is not actually a single, continuous wall. It's a network of walls, towers, and fortresses. Some parts of the wall are wide enough for five horses to ride side by side, while other sections are much narrower. The highest point of the wall is about 14 metres tall.</p>

    <p>Building the Great Wall was an enormous task that took millions of workers. Many people died during its construction, and there's a legend that their bodies were buried within the wall. While this isn't true, it shows how challenging and dangerous the work was.</p>

    <p>Today, the Great Wall of China is recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Millions of people visit it each year, marvelling at its size and the skill of the ancient builders. While much of the wall has crumbled over time, significant portions have been restored, allowing visitors to walk along it and imagine what life was like for the soldiers who once guarded China's borders.</p>
