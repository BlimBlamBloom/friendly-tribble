    <h1>Tarra and Bella: The Elephant and Her Best Friend</h1>
    <p><em>This is about an A2 level.</em></p>

    <!-- Article Content -->
    <p>In a large sanctuary in Tennessee, USA, lives an elephant named Tarra. Tarra is not just any elephant—she had a best friend named Bella, who was a dog. Their friendship was very special, and it touched the hearts of many people around the world.</p>
    <p>Tarra and Bella met at the sanctuary where Tarra lived. Bella was a stray dog that wandered into the sanctuary one day. From the moment they met, Tarra and Bella became inseparable. They spent all their time together, walking, playing, and even sleeping side by side.</p>
    <p>The workers at the sanctuary were amazed by their strong bond. They would see Tarra gently picking Bella up with her trunk, helping her reach places she couldn’t on her own. Bella, in return, loved to run around Tarra’s big legs and rest by her side. Even though Tarra was a big elephant and Bella was a small dog, they were the best of friends.</p>
    <p>Sadly, Bella passed away a few years ago. Tarra was very sad, but she never forgot her friend. The story of Tarra and Bella shows us that true friendship can happen between the most unlikely pairs. Their friendship reminds us that love and kindness have no size or shape.</p>
