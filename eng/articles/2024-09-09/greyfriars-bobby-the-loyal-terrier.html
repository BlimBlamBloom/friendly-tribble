    <!-- Story Title -->
    <h1>Greyfriars Bobby: The Loyal Terrier</h1>

    <p>Greyfriars Bobby was a small dog with a big heart. He lived in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the 19th century and became famous for his loyalty to his owner.</p>
    <p>Bobby was a Skye Terrier, a small breed with long hair and a friendly nature. He was very close to his owner, a man named John Gray. Bobby and John were always together, whether walking through the streets of Edinburgh or sitting by the fireplace at home.</p>
    <p>When John Gray passed away in 1858, he was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, a cemetery in Edinburgh. Bobby was heartbroken, but he didn’t forget his owner. For the next 14 years, Bobby stayed by John’s grave. Every day, he would sit by the grave, keeping watch over his beloved owner. The people of Edinburgh noticed Bobby’s loyalty and began to care for him, bringing him food and making sure he was safe.</p>
    <p>Bobby’s dedication touched the hearts of many people. He became a local legend, and his story spread far and wide. Even after Bobby passed away in 1872, he was remembered as a symbol of loyalty and devotion. A statue of Greyfriars Bobby was placed near the entrance of Greyfriars Kirkyard, where it still stands today.</p>
    <p>In addition to becoming a local legend, Bobby's story was so touching that it inspired several films. One of the most famous is *Greyfriars Bobby: The True Story of a Dog*, released by Disney in 1961. Bobby's loyalty and devotion also became the subject of other movies and books, ensuring that his story will continue to be shared with new generations. Today, visitors to Edinburgh can still see the statue of Greyfriars Bobby, a reminder of his incredible bond with his owner.</p>
