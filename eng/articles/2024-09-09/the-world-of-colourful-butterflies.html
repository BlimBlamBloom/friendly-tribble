    <h1>The World of Colourful Butterflies</h1>
    <p><em>This article is about an A2 level.</em></p>

    <!-- Story Content -->
    <p>Butterflies are some of the most beautiful creatures in the world. Their wings are like pieces of art, painted in bright colours and amazing patterns. You can find butterflies in many different places, from gardens and forests to meadows and parks.</p>
    <p>There are thousands of species of butterflies, each with its own unique colours and designs. Some butterflies have wings that look like stained glass, with colourful spots and stripes. Others have simple, elegant patterns in shades of white, black, and brown.</p>
    <p>One of the most famous butterflies is the Monarch butterfly. It is known for its bright orange and black wings. Monarch butterflies are also famous for their long journey, called migration. Every year, they fly thousands of kilometers from Canada and the United States to Mexico to stay warm during the winter.</p>
    <p>Another beautiful butterfly is the Blue Morpho. It has bright blue wings that shimmer in the sunlight. This butterfly lives in the rainforests of Central and South America. When the Blue Morpho flies, its wings look like flashes of blue light.</p>
    <p>Butterflies are not only beautiful to look at, but they also play an important role in nature. They help plants grow by moving pollen from one flower to another. This process is called pollination. Without butterflies and other pollinators, many of the plants we eat would not be able to grow.</p>
    <p>Next time you see a butterfly, take a moment to enjoy its beauty. These colourful creatures remind us of the amazing diversity of life on Earth.</p>
