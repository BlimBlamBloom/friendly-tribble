    <h1>The Rise of Electric Scooters</h1>
    <p><em>This article is around a B1 level.</em></p>

    <!-- Article Content -->
    <p>In recent years, electric scooters have become a common sight in cities around the world. These small, battery-powered vehicles offer a quick and easy way to travel short distances, especially in crowded urban areas. Electric scooters are popular because they are convenient, environmentally friendly, and affordable.</p>
    <p>People often use electric scooters for their daily commutes, running errands, or simply enjoying a ride around town. Many cities have introduced shared electric scooter programs, where users can rent a scooter for a short time using a smartphone app. This has made electric scooters accessible to a wider audience, including tourists who want to explore the city in a fun and efficient way.</p>
    <p>However, the rise of electric scooters has also brought some challenges. In many cities, there are concerns about safety, as some riders do not follow traffic rules, leading to accidents. Additionally, scooters are sometimes left on sidewalks, blocking paths for pedestrians and causing inconvenience.</p>
    <p>Another issue is that not everyone agrees on where electric scooters should be allowed to operate. Some people think they should be restricted to bike lanes, while others believe they should be banned from certain areas altogether. Cities are working to find solutions to these problems by creating new regulations and improving infrastructure to support safe scooter use.</p>
    <p>Despite these challenges, electric scooters continue to grow in popularity. They offer an efficient and eco-friendly alternative to cars for short trips, helping to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. As more people choose electric scooters for their daily transportation, cities will need to adapt to ensure that everyone can share the roads safely and responsibly.</p>
