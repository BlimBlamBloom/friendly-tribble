    <h1>The Magic of Rainbows</h1>
    <p><em>This article is about an A2 level.</em></p>

    <!-- Article Content -->
    <p>Rainbows are one of the most beautiful things in nature. They are colourful, bright, and make people smile when they appear in the sky. But how do rainbows form, and why do we see them?</p>
    <p>A rainbow happens when sunlight passes through raindrops in the sky. The light bends and then spreads out into different colours. These colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The colours always appear in the same order, which is why we see a perfect arc of colour in the sky.</p>
    <p>Rainbows usually appear when the sun is shining, and it’s raining at the same time. The sun needs to be behind you, and the rain needs to be in front of you to see a rainbow. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you can see a double rainbow, which has two arcs of colour!</p>
    <p>Rainbows have been special to people for a long time. In many cultures, they are a symbol of hope and happiness. In Irish folklore, it is said that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, guarded by a leprechaun. This legend has made rainbows a symbol of good fortune in Ireland.</p>
    <p>In other cultures, rainbows are seen as bridges between the earth and the heavens. For example, in Norse mythology, the rainbow bridge Bifröst connects the world of humans with the realm of the gods. In the Navajo culture, rainbows are seen as a sign of peace and harmony.</p>
    <p>Rainbows are also popular in art, stories, and songs. People love to draw and paint rainbows because they are so colourful. Seeing a rainbow can make any day feel magical!</p>
