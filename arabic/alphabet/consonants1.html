    <h1>Consonants 1</h1>
    <p>
        There are two very distinct things about the Arabic writing system that you should know before we start. 
        First off, it is written from right to left. This is the opposite direction of English. Second, each letter 
        is written differently depending on its position in the word (beginning, middle, or end). 
    </p>
    <p>
        For now, we will ignore those two features for simplicity and focus on individual letters. There is an order 
        in which the Arabic alphabet is written and I do recommend learning that, but in this practice we're going to 
        just focus on 15 letters that I think are good to start with for English speakers. Most of them are sounds 
        that we have in English or are written similarly to other letters. For pronunciation examples, there are countless 
        videos online that can demonstrate better than I can. Please find one you like and follow along. Here is the list:
